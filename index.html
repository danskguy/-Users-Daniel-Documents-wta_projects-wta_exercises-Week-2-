				<p>A friend from work introduced me to coding and I really liked it and so I started to learn on my own. I have been working at my job for a year now and I have hit the top I can go. I tried and I am still trying to move up in the company and still nothing after 3 months. I started looking at other jobs in the valley. I noticed that there were always a need for people that can code. I started looking into a Computer Science degree and bootcamps. I really liked the idea of going to a school, but most of them cost a lot of money and are full time. My wife saw an offer at World Tech Academy and gave them my information. I forgot about it as the weeks passed and then I got a call from Jeff. I was really interested and I liked the times and the benefits of the academy. That is a little story on how I got here.</p>

				<p>The bottom line is, I want to provide for my family. I was looking for a career path, I already know that I love languages and I like jobs that deal with comupters. I got introduced to coding and I feel that I can learn it fast and boost my career. Even with WTA I will still get a degree in Comupter Science. With the help of WTA I will have professional help that will get me a jump start to my career and a better job that will give me the knowledge and experience as I get my degree.</p>
