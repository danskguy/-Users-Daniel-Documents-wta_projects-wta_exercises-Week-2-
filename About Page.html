                <p>My name is Daniel Guyaux, my last name is French and it is pronounced Guy-o. I am 25, I got married in April of 2018. I met my wife at a singles ward in January of 2017 and I asked her for her number and then on a date. She is from Venezuela. She had only been here for 4 months when we met and I had been home for my mission 4 months from Tahiti as well. We went on dates every week for 3 months. I got to know her a lot and I helped her with English and she helped me with Spanish.</p>
                <p>In April of 2017, we became boyfriend girlfriend</p>
